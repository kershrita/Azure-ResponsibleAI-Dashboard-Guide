## Overview
Provide a brief overview of what Azure Responsible AI is and its key features. Include any relevant links to official documentation or additional resources.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Azure Subscription

### Installation

#### Option 1: Working on the Local Machine

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kershrita/ResponsibleAI-Dashboard-Guide
   cd ResponsibleAI-Dashboard-Guide/lib
   ```

2. **Create Conda Environment:**
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml -n RAI
   ```

3. **Activate Conda Environment:**
   ```
   conda activate RAI
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Now, you have set up your local environment for Responsible AI. You can proceed with using the Responsible AI features in your project.

--------------------------------------

#### Option 2: Working Remotely in GitHub Codespaces

1. **Open GitHub Codespace:**
   Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces. After the Codespace is loaded, navigate to the `lib` directory.
